hideAnnoyingContent
==============

## Short description
Javascript userfile to hide content on your Facebook's timeline that contain your specified words (also work with the name of pages, friends, etc).
I created this script because I have a lot of friends or pages that I like the published content, but sometimes I annoy or bore me a lot.

## Requirements
* A browser that support userscript ( eg.Firefox with Greasemonkey)
* A browser that support HTML5 ( http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/html5.html )

## Usage:
When you visit your Facebook timeline a simple form appear on the top-left of page. You can simply insert your 'annoing words' separate by comma and save them. After this push the button 'Hide!' to hide the contents.
When you have saved your words after page reload or a content-refresh you can only push the button 'Hide!'.


#### Installation
copy/paste the code ( or install with userscript.org's support - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/162526 )
